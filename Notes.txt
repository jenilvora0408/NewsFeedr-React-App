React Component Lifecycle:

-> The series of events that happen from the mounting of a React Component to its unmounting.

a) Mounting - Birth of a Component
b) Update - Growth of a Component
c) Unmount - Death of a Component

Methods in React Component Lifecycle:

-> The render() method is used to render HTML of the component in react. 
-> This method is required for a class-based component to render the DOM.
-> It runs during the mounting & updating of a component.
-> render() method should be pure i.e. you cannot modify state inside it.
-> Here, pure means for a particular input, the output produced will remain same.

-> The componentDidMount() method runs after the component has been rendered to the DOM.
-> The componentdidUpdate() method is invoked as soon as the updating happens. 
-> The most common use case for the componentDidUpdate() method is updating the DOM in response to prop or state changes.
-> The componentWillUnmount() lifecycle method is called before the component is unmounted & destroyed. Usually used to perform cleanups.
